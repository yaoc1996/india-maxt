There are two types of CSV files:

1. Regular type -- Very intuitive, the columns are properly labeled.
2. Grid type -- There is a column named Latitude, the rest of the column names represented the Longitude. For the cells to the right of the Latitude column and under the Longitude column names, each cell value represents the value at the grid specified by the latitude and longitude.
